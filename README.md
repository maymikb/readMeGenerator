## Description
The motivation for this app was to make the understanding of code quick and clear, thus making it easier for others to contribute to and update/perfect the code for an adaptable app, making it easier to accept and use customer feedback to make improvements. Having a common platform/boiler plate generating README's which will introduce the project and give a brief overview will save the coders time. Adding a clear README to oneâ€™s project helps to understad the logic behind the code, making it easier to improve/help/contribute.
